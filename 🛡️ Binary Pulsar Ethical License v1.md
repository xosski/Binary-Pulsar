üõ°Ô∏è Binary Pulsar Ethical License v1.0
TL;DR
Use it to test. Use it to defend.
Never use it to harm, silence, or exploit.

1. Permission
You are hereby granted a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, distribute, and build upon Binary Pulsar for the following purposes:

Security research and red-team simulation

Blue-team training and defense strategy development

Ethical hacking in authorized environments

Education and academic experimentation

2. Restrictions
You may not:

Use this software to deploy, disguise, or assist malware, spyware, or surveillance systems.

Use it to facilitate, host, or reconstruct content involving child abuse, human trafficking, non-consensual imagery, or illegal weapons trade.

Operate or distribute this tool in any environment where you do not have full legal and ethical consent to test.

Use this tool to bypass informed consent, exfiltrate private data, or deceive users into executing unknown code.

3. Ethical Clause: DriftNet Reciprocity
Any use of Binary Pulsar within decentralized systems (e.g. DriftNet) must reward participants who prioritize digital safety.
This includes, but is not limited to:

Validating fragments that identify or neutralize illicit content

Flagging entropy anomalies linked to blacklisted payloads

Upholding safety-first consensus in peer validation systems

Failure to do so revokes this license by default.

4. Liability & Warranty
This software is provided as is, with no warranty, no guarantee of fitness, and no liability implied or offered by its creators.
If you break something ‚Äî you fix it.
If you get caught ‚Äî you stand for it.
If you cause harm ‚Äî you never used this.

5. Final Word
This isn‚Äôt a weapon.
It‚Äôs a lens.
And if you sharpen it into a blade ‚Äî you hold the guilt, not the code.
